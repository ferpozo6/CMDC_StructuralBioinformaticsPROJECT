abstract = {Recently exciting progress has been made on protein contact prediction, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not very useful for de novo structure prediction. This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual networks. This deep neural network allows us to model very complex sequence-contact relationship as well as long-range inter-contact correlation. Our method greatly outperforms existing contact prediction methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted protein folding. Tested on three datasets of 579 proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, the representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore{\textgreater}0.6) for 203 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 proteins, respectively. Further, our contact-assisted models have much better quality than template-based models. Using our predicted contacts as restraints, we can (ab initio) fold 208 of the 398 membrane proteins with TMscore{\textgreater}0.5. By contrast, when the training proteins of our method are used as templates, homology modeling can only do so for 10 of them. One interesting finding is that even if we do not train our prediction models with any membrane proteins, our method works very well on membrane protein prediction. Finally, in recent blind CAMEO benchmark our method successfully folded 5 test proteins with a novel fold.},

abstract = {In this work we present a novel correlated mutations analysis (CMA) method that is significantly more accurate than previously reported CMA methods. Calculation of correlation coefficients is based on physicochemical properties of residues (predictors) and not on substitution matrices. This results in reliable prediction of pairs of residues that are distant in protein sequence but proximal in its three dimensional tertiary structure. Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) containing a sequence of known structure for 127 families from PFAM database have been selected so that all major protein architectures described in CATH classification database are represented. Protein sequences in the selected families were filtered so that only those evolutionarily close to the target protein remain in the MSA. The average accuracy obtained for the alpha beta class of proteins was 26.8{\%} of predicted proximal pairs with average improvement over random accuracy (IOR) of 6.41. Average accuracy is 20.6{\%} for the mainly beta class and 14.4{\%} for the mainly alpha class. The optimum correlation coefficient cutoff (cc cutoff) was found to be around 0.65. The first predictor, which correlates to hydrophobicity, provides the most reliable results. The other two predictors give good predictions which can be used in conjunction to those of the first one. When stricter cc cutoff is chosen, the average accuracy increases significantly (38.76{\%} for alpha beta class), but the trade off is a smaller number of predictions. The use of solvent accessible area estimations for filtering false positives out of the predictions is promising.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Diverse studies have shown that correlated mutation (CM) is an important molecular evolutionary process alongside conservation. However, attempts to find the residue pairs that co-evolve under the structural and/or functional constraints are complicated by the fact that a large portion of covariance signals found in multiple sequence alignments arise from correlations due to common ancestry and stochastic noise. RESULTS Assuming that the background noise can be estimated from the coevolutionary relationships among residues, we propose a new measure for background noise called the normalized coevolutionary pattern similarity (NCPS) score. By subtracting NCPS scores from raw CM scores and combining the results with an entropy factor, we show that these new scores effectively reduce the background noise. To test the effectiveness of this method in detecting residue pairs coevolving under the structural constraints, two independent test sets were performed, showing that this new method performs better than the most accurate method currently available. In addition, we also applied our method to double mutant cycle experiments and protein-protein interactions. Although more rigorous tests are required, we obtained promising results that our method tended to explain those data better than other methods. These results suggest that the new noise-reduced CM scores developed in this study can be a valuable tool for the study of correlated mutations under the structural and/or functional constraints in proteins.

abstract = {Author Summary$\backslash$nPoint mutations (i.e., changes of a single sequence element) can have a severe impact on protein function. Many diseases are caused by such minute defects. On the other hand, the majority of such mutations does not lead to noticeable effects. Although previous research has revealed important aspects that influence or predict the chance of a mutation to cause disease, much remains to be learned before we fully understand this complex problem. In our work, we use the observation that sometimes certain positions in a protein mutate in an apparently correlated fashion and analyze this correlation with respect to mutation vulnerability. Our results show that positions exhibiting evolutionary correlation are significantly more likely to be vulnerable to mutation than average positions. On one hand, our data further support the concept of correlated positions to not only be associated with protein contacts but also functional sites and/or disease positions (as introduced by others). On the other hand, this could be useful to further improve the understanding and prediction of the consequences of mutations. Our work is the first to attempt a large-scale quantitation of this relationship.},

abstract = {Since the cooperative mechanism between interconnected residues plays a critical role in protein functions, the detection of coevolving residues is important for studying various biological functions of proteins. In this work, we developed a new correlated mutation analysis method that shows substantially better prediction accuracy than all other methods. More importantly, the prediction accuracy of our new method is insensitive to the characteristics of the multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) from which the correlated mutation scores are calculated. Thanks to this desirable property, not only it does it show a good performance even for MSAs automatically generated by sequence homology methodologies, which allows us to build a fully automatic easy-to-use server named CMAT, but its performance is also consistently high on the columns of MSAs containing a high fraction of gaps, which greatly extends the applicability of the correlated mutation analysis. The key development of this work is the joint probability estimation that can be greatly improved by utilizing sequence profile as prior knowledge, which is shown to be highly beneficial to the correlated mutation analysis and its applications. From the computational perspective, we made two important findings; the sequence profile can be used to estimate the pseudocounts, and the consistency rule on joint probabilities and marginal probabilities is important for accurately estimating the joint probability.

This fact can be exploited to interpret correlated mutations observed in a sequence family as an indication of probable physical contact in three dimensions. Here we present a simple and general method to analyze correlations in mutational behavior between different positions in a multiple sequence alignment. We then use these correlations to predict contact maps for each of 11 protein families and compare the result with the contacts determined by crystallography. For the most strongly correlated residue pairs predicted to be in contact, the prediction accuracy ranges from 37 to 68{\%} and the improvement ratio relative to a random prediction from 1.4 to 5.1. Predicted contact maps can be used as input for the calculation of protein tertiary structure, either from sequence information alone or in combination with experimental information.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional structures of proteins are the support of their biological functions. Their folds are stabilized by contacts between residues. Inner protein contacts are generally described through direct atomic contacts, i.e. interactions between side-chain atoms, while contact prediction methods mainly used inter-C$\alpha$ distances. In this paper, we have analyzed the protein contacts on a recent high quality non-redundant databank using different criteria. First, we have studied the average number of contacts depending on the distance threshold to define a contact. Preferential contacts between types of amino acids have been highlighted. Detailed analyses have been done concerning the proximity of contacts in the sequence, the size of the proteins and fold classes. The strongest differences have been extracted, highlighting important residues. Then, we studied the influence of five different side-chain conformation prediction methods (SCWRL, IRECS, SCAP, SCATD and SCCOMP) on the distribution of contacts. The prediction rates of these different methods are quite similar. However, using a distance criterion between side chains, the results are quite different, e.g. SCAP predicts 50{\%} more contacts than observed, unlike other methods that predict fewer contacts than observed. Contacts deduced are quite distinct from one method to another with at most 75{\%} contacts in common. Moreover, distributions of amino acid preferential contacts present unexpected behaviours distinct from previously observed in the X-ray structures, especially at the surface of proteins. For instance, the interactions involving Tryptophan greatly decrease. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},
